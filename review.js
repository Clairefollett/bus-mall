//this is right after you assign displayArea:
//for(var i = 0; i < paths.length; i++) {
  //var newItem = new ItemImage(paths[i]);
  //items.push(newItem);
  //}
//this for loop is going through the entire array one number at a time. The varaible i starts at 0 and goes up by one everytime.

//this is a constructor function which makes each image an object with the image name as it's property. And how many times it has been clicked, with the this.clicked property starting at 0.
//function ItemImage(path) {
  //this.path = '../bus-mall/img/' + path
  //this.clicked = 0;
  //}
